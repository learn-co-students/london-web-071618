Sinatra is a DSL that handles routing

Model - Kitchen
classes that we are storing data ins

View - Customer
giving us a way to visualize our data
giving us a way to interact with our data visually

Controller - Waiter
is going to interact with our model
package up model data so view can render it


REpresentational State Transfer
- url should reflect state of the application
- convention and consistency
- index: /books
- show: /books/:id

CRUD
- all data gets:
  - created
  - read
  - updated
  - destroyed
